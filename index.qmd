I am a Research Associate (postdoc) in the Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge, working on multiscale modelling with [Prof. Mark Girolami](https://prof-girolami.uk), on the PREMIERE grant. I am also affiliated with Mark's [Computational Statistics and Machine Learning (CSML) group](https://csml-cam.github.io) at the University of Cambridge.

Previously, I was a PhD student in computational statistics and applied mathematics at the University of Western Australia, supervised by [Edward Cripps](https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/persons/edward-cripps) and [Thomas Stemler](https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/persons/thomas-stemler), where I worked on model-data synthesis for nonlinear PDEs modelled by finite elements.

See [here](/about.qmd) for more info on my research.
