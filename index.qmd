I am a Research Engineer in the [Biodiversity Futures Lab](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/research/projects/predicts.html) at the [Natural History Museum](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/) in London. I lead the software engineering behind the [Biodiversity Intactness Index](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/services/data/biodiversity-intactness-index.html).

This involves a mixture of statistical modelling, data engineering, and HPC to produce a reproducible and efficient pipeline to generate global biodiversity data. I am fortunate to work with an amazing team of computational ecologists and data scientists.

I come from a research background in computational statistics and scientific ML, completing a Postdoc at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), and a PhD from the [University of Western Australia](https://www.uwa.edu.au/).

To get an idea of the sorts of things I work on, head to the [code](./code.qmd) tab, or see some of the [talks](./talks.qmd) I have given over the years.
