I am a Research Software Engineer in the [Biodiversity Futures Lab](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/research/projects/predicts.html) at the [Natural History Museum](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/) in London. I work on writing code to model Biodiversity change - the so-called [Biodiversity Intactness Index](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/services/data/biodiversity-intactness-index.html).

Before that, I was Postdoc in the Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge, working with [Prof. Mark Girolami](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=BSoawXwAAAAJ&view_op=list_works). Even before that, I was a PhD student in computational statistics and applied mathematics at the University of Western Australia, supervised by [Edward Cripps](https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/persons/edward-cripps) and [Thomas Stemler](https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/persons/thomas-stemler), where I worked on model-data synthesis for nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs).
