I am a Research Software Engineer in the [Biodiversity Futures Lab](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/research/projects/predicts.html) at the [Natural History Museum](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/) in London. I work on writing code to model Biodiversity change - the so-called [Biodiversity Intactness Index](https://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/services/data/biodiversity-intactness-index.html).

Before that, I was Postdoc in the Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge, and even before that, I was a PhD student in computational statistics and applied mathematics at the University of Western Australia. I researched data assimilation for fluid mechanics problems.

I am a passionate R developer and thoroughly enjoy developing pipelines to model data in all sorts of forms, with all sorts of methods.
