I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the 
Univesity of Western Australia. I am supervised by 
[Edward Cripps](https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/persons/edward-cripps),
[Thomas Stemler](https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/persons/thomas-stemler), and
[Mark Girolami](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/girolami/).
My Ph.D. is focussed in quantifying, understanding, and explaining
uncertainties in soliton models.

My research interests lie in between computational statistics and applied
Mathematics. I am particularly interested in Bayesian methods and computation,
probabilistic numerics, and uncertainty quantification.
