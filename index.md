I am a Research Associate (postdoc) in the Department of Engineering
at the University of Cambridge, working on multiscale modelling with
[Prof. Mark Girolami](https://prof-girolami.uk), on the PREMIERE
grant. I am also affiliated with Mark's [Computational Statistics and
Machine Learning (CSML) group](https://csml-cam.github.io) at the
University of Cambridge.

Previously, I was a PhD student in computational statistics and
applied mathematics at the University of Western Australia, supervised by [Edward
Cripps](https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/persons/edward-cripps) and
[Thomas
Stemler](https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/persons/thomas-stemler),
where I worked on model-data synthesis for nonlinear PDEs modelled by finite
elements.

See [here](/research/) for more info on my research.
