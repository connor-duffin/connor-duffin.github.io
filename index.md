I am a PhD student in computational statistics and applied mathematics at the
University of Western Australia. I am supervised by 
[Edward Cripps](https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/persons/edward-cripps),
[Thomas Stemler](https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/persons/thomas-stemler), and
[Mark Girolami](https://prof-girolami.uk). My PhD is on developing statistical
methodology to deal with uncertainty in numerical models. See [here](/research/)
for more info.
