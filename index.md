I am a Research Assistant in the Department of Engineering at the University of
Cambridge, working on multiscale modelling with [Prof. Mark
Girolami](https://prof-girolami.uk), on the PREMIERE grant. I am also affiliated
with Mark's [Computational Statistics and Machine Learning (CSML)
group](https://csml-cam.github.io) at the University of Cambridge.

Concurrently, I am also finishing off my PhD in computational statistics and
applied mathematics at the University of Western Australia, supervised by [Edward
Cripps](https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/persons/edward-cripps) and
[Thomas
Stemler](https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/persons/thomas-stemler),
where I work on model-data synthesis for nonlinear PDEs modelled by finite
elements.

See [here](/research/) for more info on my research.

Outside of work I like music and climbing rocks :)
