I try to put most of my code online when I think that it is of general utility. I've tried to summarise these works here:

* [statfenics](https://github.com/connor-duffin/statfenics): a set of tools to help when doing statistical things with [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/). Includes functions to build Gaussian process inference on top of FEniCS, and utilities to aid in interpolating finite element solutions. This is being actively developed.
* For our [statFEM](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2015006118) filtering work there are code to accompany these papers. For the 1D case (including the internal wave experimental data) this is housed at [statkdv-paper](https://github.com/connor-duffin/statkdv-paper), and in the 2D case, this is housed at [low-rank-statfem](https://github.com/connor-duffin/low-rank-statfem). In essence, these repos contain various examples, which are implemented with [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/), to do synthetic and experimental data experiments, computing statFEM posteriors.
* [ula-statfem](https://github.com/connor-duffin/ula-statfem): code to explore Langevin dynamics samplers with [statFEM](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2015006118). Published in [SIAM JUQ](https://doi.org/10.1137/21M1463094). Includes [sfmcmc](https://github.com/connor-duffin/ula-statfem/tree/main/sfmcmc) package which implements a bunch of different MCMC samplers, including ULA [(see this classic paper)](https://doi.org/10.3150/18-BEJ1073), [MALA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis-adjusted_Langevin_algorithm), and [preconditioned Crank-Nicolson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preconditioned_Crank%E2%80%93Nicolson_algorithm).
