## statFEM for nonlinear problems

The [statFEM](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cma.2020.113533) is a methodology to synthesise finite element models with data. Our work extended this to nonlinear, time-dependent PDEs, with low-rank covariances for scalable computation (see [here](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2015006118) and [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2022.111261)). We take a nonlinear, time-dependent PDE:

$$
u_t + \mathcal{L} u + \mathcal{F}(u) = \xi,
$$

$u := u(x, t)$, $x \in \mathcal{D} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, $t \in [0, T]$, and embed a *Gaussian process* $\xi \sim \mathcal{GP}(0, \delta(t - t') \cdot k(x, x'))$ inside of PDE, to capture structural model imperfection.

If we discretise the above then we can write out a transition density $p(u_h^n | u_h^{n - 1}) = \mathcal{N}(\mathcal{M}(u_h^{n - 1}), G)$, where $u_h^n$ is our finite element discretised solution, at time $n\Delta t$. Combining with an observation model allows for general nonlinear filtering. If we have a linear Gaussian observation model then we get something like:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  p(u_h^n | u_h^{n - 1}) &= \mathcal{N}(\mathcal{M}(u_h^{n - 1}), G), \\
  p(y_n | u_h^{n - 1}) &= \mathcal{N}(H(u_h^n), \sigma_n^2 I).
\end{aligned}
$$

This permits the usual nonlinear filtering (like the [ensemble Kalman filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_Kalman_filter) or the [extended Kalman filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Kalman_filter)), which computes the posterior $p(u_h^n | y_{1:n})$.
