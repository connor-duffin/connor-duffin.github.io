    "text": "My current research is on blending physical systems with observed data via Bayesian statistical methods. My PhD focused on extending the statistical finite element method (statFEM) to handle nonlinearity and time-dependence. The first work, establishing the methodology, was published here, and the code is available here. We have extended this work to scale to high-dimensional systems, as motivated by reaction-diffusion problems. This was published in the Journal of Computational Physics here, and the code is available here. We’ve done some further work on looking at Langevin samplers for statFEM — see here for the paper, and here for the code.\nPrior to starting my PhD, I did my Bachelors and Honours in Computational Statistics (also at UWA). I worked on modelling rainfall with MCMC, under Edward Cripps and Michael Bertolacci.\nMy research interests include Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification/Inverse problems, Bayesian analysis of differential equations, and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.\n\n\nDuffin, C., Branson, P., Rayson, M., Girolami, M., Cripps, E., Stemler, T., 2023.

    "text": "statFEM for nonlinear problems\nThe statFEM is a methodology to synthesise finite element models with data. Our work extended this to nonlinear, time-dependent PDEs, with low-rank covariances for scalable computation (see here and here). We take a nonlinear, time-dependent PDE:\n\\[\nu_t + \\mathcal{L} u + \\mathcal{F}(u) = \\xi,\n\\]\n\\(u := u(x, t)\\), \\(x \\in \\mathcal{D} \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^d\\), \\(t \\in [0, T]\\), and embed a Gaussian process \\(\\xi \\sim \\mathcal{GP}(0, \\delta(t - t') \\cdot k(x, x'))\\) inside of PDE, to capture structural model imperfection.\nIf we discretise the above then we can write out a transition density \\(p(u_h^n | u_h^{n - 1}) = \\mathcal{N}(\\mathcal{M}(u_h^{n - 1}), G)\\), where \\(u_h^n\\) is our finite element discretised solution, at time \\(n\\Delta t\\). Combining with an observation model allows for general nonlinear filtering. If we have a linear Gaussian observation model then we get something like:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n  p(u_h^n | u_h^{n - 1}) &= \\mathcal{N}(\\mathcal{M}(u_h^{n - 1}), G), \\\\\n  p(y_n | u_h^{n - 1}) &= \\mathcal{N}(H(u_h^n), \\sigma_n^2 I).\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis permits the usual nonlinear filtering (like the ensemble Kalman filter or the extended Kalman filter), which computes the posterior \\(p(u_h^n | y_{1:n})\\).\n\n\n\nWe tested these methods on a bunch of different PDEs: the above is from a case study where we assimilated experimental data with a statFEM Korteweg-de Vries equation."

I’ve tried to summarise these works here:\n\nstatfenics: a set of tools to help when doing statistical things with FEniCS. Includes functions to build Gaussian process inference on top of FEniCS, and utilities to aid in interpolating finite element solutions. This is being actively developed.\nFor our statFEM filtering work there are code to accompany these papers. For the 1D case (including the internal wave experimental data) this is housed at statkdv-paper, and in the 2D case, this is housed at low-rank-statfem. In essence, these repos contain various examples, which are implemented with FEniCS, to do synthetic and experimental data experiments, computing statFEM posteriors.\nula-statfem: code to explore Langevin dynamics samplers with statFEM. Published in SIAM JUQ. Includes sfmcmc package which implements a bunch of different MCMC samplers, including ULA (see this classic paper), MALA, and preconditioned Crank-Nicolson."
