# research

I am currently working on applying the statistical finite element method to
handle nonlinearity and time-dependence, as applied to internal waves modelled
by the KdV equation. This is published
[here](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/2/e2015006118), and the code is
available [here](https://www.github.com/connor-duffin/statkdv-paper).

Prior to starting my PhD, I did an honours degree (similar to a UK Bachelor +
MRes) in computational statistics (also at UWA). I worked on modelling rainfall
with MCMC, under [Edward Cripps](https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/persons/edward-cripps) and
[Michael Bertolacci](https://mbertolacci.github.io).

My research interests include Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification/Inverse
Problems, Bayesian analysis of differential equations, and Markov chain Monte
Carlo methods.
