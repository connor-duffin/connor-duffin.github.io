# research

I am currently working on applying the statistical finite element method to
handle nonlinearity and time-dependence, as applied to internal waves modelled
by the KdV equation. This is in press at the moment and will be published soon.
The code for this paper is located 
[here](https://www.github.com/connor-duffin/statkdv-paper).

Prior to starting my PhD, I did an honours degree in computational statistics (also
at UWA). I worked on modelling rainfall with MCMC, under
[Edward Cripps](https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/persons/edward-cripps)
and [Michael Bertolacci](https://mbertolacci.github.io).

My research interests include Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification/Inverse
Problems, Bayesian analysis of differential equations, and Markov chain Monte
Carlo methods.
