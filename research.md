# research

My current research is on blending PDE systems with observed data via Bayesian
statistical methods. My PhD has focused on extending the statistical finite
element method (*statFEM*) to handle nonlinearity and time-dependence. The first
work, establishing the methodology, was published
[here](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/2/e2015006118), and the code is
available [here](https://www.github.com/connor-duffin/statkdv-paper). We have
extended this work to scale to high-dimensional systems, as motivated by
reaction-diffusion problems. This was published in the Journal of Computational
Physics [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2022.111261), and the code is
available [here](https://github.com/connor-duffin/low-rank-statfem).

Prior to starting my PhD, I did an honours degree (similar to a UK Bachelor +
MRes) in computational statistics (also at UWA). I worked on modelling rainfall
with MCMC, under [Edward Cripps](https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/persons/edward-cripps) and
[Michael Bertolacci](https://mbertolacci.github.io).

My research interests include Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification/Inverse
Problems, Bayesian analysis of differential equations, and Markov chain Monte
Carlo methods.
