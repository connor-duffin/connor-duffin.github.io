# research

My current research is on blending PDE systems with observed data via Bayesian
statistical methods. My PhD has focused on applying the statistical finite
element method to handle nonlinearity and time-dependence. The first work,
establishing the methodology, is published
[here](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/2/e2015006118), and the code is
available [here](https://www.github.com/connor-duffin/statkdv-paper). We hav
extended this work to scale to high-dimensional systems, as motivated by
reaction-diffusion problems. A pre-print is available
[here](http://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04757), and the code is available
[here](https://github.com/connor-duffin/low-rank-statfem).

Prior to starting my PhD, I did an honours degree (similar to a UK Bachelor +
MRes) in computational statistics (also at UWA). I worked on modelling rainfall
with MCMC, under [Edward Cripps](https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/persons/edward-cripps) and
[Michael Bertolacci](https://mbertolacci.github.io).

My research interests include Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification/Inverse
Problems, Bayesian analysis of differential equations, and Markov chain Monte
Carlo methods.
