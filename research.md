I am currently working on applying the statistical finite element method to
handle nonlinearity and time-dependence in an internal wave model. Paper and
code to be released soon.

Prior to starting my PhD, I did an honours degree in computational statistics (also
at UWA). I worked on modelling rainfall with MCMC, under
[Edward Cripps](https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/persons/edward-cripps)
and [Michael Bertolacci](https://mbertolacci.github.io). Publication currently
under preparation.
