This code computes the posterior (filtering) distribution using extended and ensemble Kalman filters.\nThe 2D case is located here. This also computes the posterior filtering distribution using a low-rank extended Kalman filter algorithm.\n\nula-statfem: code to explore Langevin dynamics samplers with statFEM. Published in SIAM JUQ. Includes sfmcmc package which implements a bunch of different MCMC samplers, including ULA (see this classic paper), MALA, and preconditioned Crank-Nicolson.\nstatfenics: a set of tools to help when doing statistics with FEniCS. Includes functions to build Gaussian process inference on top of FEniCS, and utilities to aid in interpolating finite element solutions."

I work on writing code to model Biodiversity change - the so-called Biodiversity Intactness Index.\nBefore that, I was Postdoc in the Department of Engineering at the University of Cambridge, and even before that, I was a PhD student in computational statistics and applied mathematics at the University of Western Australia. I researched data assimilation for fluid mechanics problems.\nI am a passionate R developer and thoroughly enjoy developing pipelines to model data in all sorts of forms, with all sorts of methods."
